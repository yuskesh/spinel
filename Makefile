# Bundled carried-C spin packages (Path B). Defined here, before `all`, because
# GNU Make expands a rule's prerequisites immediately when the rule is read -- a
# definition further down would expand to empty in `all`'s prereq list. The
# build rule + rationale live further below (near the runtime archive).
# The probe compiles AND LINKS a use of the API sp_openssl.c needs, not just
# the header: a system with headers but no libssl, or one too old for
# TLS_client_method, would otherwise pass the header check and fail at the
# package's own link.
#
# KEG-ONLY INSTALLS. On a Homebrew host the headers and libraries are real
# but off the default search path, so a bare $(CC) fails this probe and the
# whole package -- sp_openssl.o, `require "openssl"`, and every
# packages/openssl/test/*.rb -- drops out of the build without saying so.
# A green `make test` there has not exercised the package at all, which is
# how an .expected file for it can be written from a run that never
# happened.
#
# So: probe bare first, and only if that fails ask for a prefix and probe
# AGAIN with -I/-L. A prefix is trusted only when it passes the same
# compile-and-link probe, so a stale or partial install cannot flip this to
# yes and then fail at the package's own link. On a host where the bare
# probe already passes, nothing below runs and the build is unchanged.
# TWO questions, because they have different answers. The link probe says
# libssl is here and usable. The syntax-only compile of the package's own
# source says THIS file can be built against it -- a version floor, a renamed
# API, a missing macro. A header set that answers the first and not the second
# (LibreSSL 3.1.5, whose TLS_client_method exists but whose evp.h has no
# EVP_CTRL_AEAD_SET_IVLEN) used to pass the probe and then stop `make` in the
# middle with a #error. Compiling the real file rather than a copy of its
# version guard is what keeps the two from drifting (#4253).

# ---- Minor-mark leg (#4311) ----

# missed write barrier is invisible to it: the value stays reachable because
# every collection is a full one. This runs the one program that is built to
# catch that -- a young value stored into a long-lived thread-local map, held
# only by the map between the write and the read -- under SPINEL_GC_MINOR=1.
# It costs a fifth of a second, and it is the leg that was missing when a
# barrier pointed at the wrong object shipped.
# One leg per barrier gap that shipped. A single program was what this target
# ran when a store into a capture cell shipped with no barrier at all, so a
# fix here adds its reproducer to the list rather than testing by hand.
# SPINEL_GC_PHASES only reports; it must not change what a program computes, and
# it must say nothing at all when it is off. Both halves are the contract, and
# neither is visible to the ordinary harness, which cannot vary the environment

# The .ok target is the test's stamp. Order-only $(SPINEL) keeps a
# compiler relink from invalidating every test.
# One snapshot test: compile $< with the integrated pipeline, run, diff
# against $<.expected (or CRuby), write PASS/FAIL/ERR to $@. Shared by the
# test/ rule and the per-package rules below.
# The generated C goes to a stable path derived from $@ (not the per-test
# tmpdir): the compile hash sccache computes covers the preprocessed source,
# which embeds the input path in #line directives, so a random tmpdir path
# would give every run a fresh cache key and the cache would never hit.
# The .c/.o are deleted after the link -- only the cache entry survives.
# The generated C names the external libraries its ffi_lib declarations asked
# for, as `/* SPINEL_LINK: -lfoo */` markers -- the same ones the spinel driver
# scrapes when it drives cc itself. This rule drives cc directly, so it has to
# read them too, or a package binding a system library (openssl) fails to link.
# Link what the driver would link. A TU that uses Thread carries codegen's
# /* SPINEL_USES_THREADS */ marker, and src/main.c answers it with the
# -DSP_THREADS archive plus -lpthread; the harness used to link the N=1
# cooperative archive for every test, so every threaded test ran in a
# configuration that never ships -- and a test whose main thread blocks in a
# syscall while another green thread must make progress deadlocked here and
# nowhere else. The PCH is dropped on that path: it was built without
# -DSP_THREADS and -Werror rejects the mismatch.
# `bigopt` below: -O1 beats -O0 on a typical test, because the optimizer prunes
# spinel_rt.h's 800+ unreferenced statics before codegen (see the OPT=-O1 note on
# `check`). But the cost of the passes that stay is superlinear in the size of
# ONE function, and a test's whole program is inlined into main. io_closed_stream
# has a 5373-line main: 82s at -O1 against 1.6s at -O0, with a roughly cubic
# curve through it (928 lines 0.9s, 3219 lines 15s, 4407 lines 43s). Past 2000
# generated lines that one function dominates and -O0 wins by a wide margin. The
# PCH is dropped with it, since it was built under the other -O and would not
# load anyway. The binaries are the same speed here -- these are wide-API tests
# rather than loops, 0.023s vs 0.024s on the worst one.

# ---- Developer gates ----
#
# `test`, `bench` and `optcarrot` only READ the compiler binaries and
# write to disjoint build/ dirs, so they run concurrently as parallel
# prerequisites. Every recursive $(MAKE) is `+`-prefixed so the jobserver
# fd is inherited; none pass an explicit -j (which would force a sub-make
# to spawn its own pool → oversubscription).

# Fast pre-commit: rebuild the compiler and run the suite. OPT=-O1 compiles
# the spinel_rt.h-heavy per-test C ~3x faster than -O0 (the optimizer prunes
# the 800+ unreferenced static fns before codegen). Skips bench/optcarrot —
# run `make gate` before pushing for those.

# SPINEL_ALLOC_REPORT / SPINEL_ALLOC_SITES (#1336): the site is an address, so
# assert the line SHAPE rather than a snapshot -- per-type lines without the
# sites gate, `site;type` lines with it, and the program's own output either way.
# Inference properties the stdout comparison cannot see: a boxed slot still
# prints the right answer, so a type regression here is invisible to `make
# test`. Assert the emitted C signature directly, the way rbs-seed-test does
# for seeds.
