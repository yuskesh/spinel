# spin packages & spin — design

The design record for Spinel's package system (**spin packages**) and its
project tool (**`spin`**). The user-facing guide is [../spin.md](../spin.md);
this document is the *why* and the *contract*: the constraints, the
requirements (R1–R10), the resolution semantics, and what remains open.

Naming note: the tool is **`spin`**, the manifest **`spin.toml`**, the
lockfile **`spin.lock`**, the unit a **package**, and the registry
[spin-index](https://github.com/matz/spin-index). "Gem" was dropped
deliberately: the mechanism shares nothing with RubyGems (no gemspec, no
runtime require, no tarballs -- sources splice into one AOT compile), and a
Ruby-evocative unit name invited expectations of compatibility the design
cannot honor. Published *repos* stay `spinel-<name>` -- that convention is
scoped to the language, like `mruby-*`.

Status: implemented through M3 — scaffold, path/git/index dependencies with
MVS selection, `spin.lock`, vendor + offline, snapshot tests, carried native
C, declared native build steps (R10), `list`/`tree`/`search`. The hermetic
end-to-end check (`tools/spin_e2e.sh`) runs inside `make check`. Sections below note the
pieces that are still specification.

## 1. Problem

External libraries used to live as `.rb` files under `lib/`, side by side
with the C runtime (`sp_*.c/h`) and the bundled stdlib. Consequences: no
boundary (what is runtime, stdlib, or replaceable library?), no identity
(no name, version, or dependency declaration), no sharing (installing a
library meant copying files into the compiler tree).

## 2. Reference points

**RubyGems/Bundler** gives the *consumer model* worth copying: a per-project
manifest, a lockfile, a flat namespace, and `require "name"` as the only
thing consumers write. Its *mechanism* (runtime `require` onto a load path,
dynamic .so extensions, install-time code execution) does not fit AOT.

**mrbgems** gives the *producer model* worth copying: a package is a source tree
compiled *into* the final binary, with a small spec. Its consumer model
(gems baked into the VM per toolchain) does not fit either: Spinel
dependencies are per-application.

Spinel wants **RubyGems' per-app consumer surface on mrbgems'
compile-into-the-binary producer model.**

## 3. Constraints peculiar to Spinel

- **C1 — whole-program AOT.** All sources are known at compile time;
  `require` is textual splicing. Packages are *source* inputs to the one
  compile: inference specializes a package's code per application. There is
  no binary package artifact and no ABI.
- **C2 — subset language.** Not every package compiles under Spinel.
  Compatibility is a first-class, testable property (the ~189k-gem probe
  corpus), not a footnote.
- **C3 — C is reachable two ways.** FFI (`ffi_lib`/`ffi_func`) to external
  libraries, and carried C inside the package tree. The runtime headers stay
  additive-only; package C must not mutate runtime internals.
- **C4 — the require-gate is the resolution point.** `require "name"`
  already resolves bundled stdlib, native features, and `-I` roots, and
  gates typed surfaces on it. Packages are one more provider behind the
  same gate — not a second mechanism. Inside a `spin` project the gate is
  strict (`SPINEL_REQUIRE_GATE=1`): the dependency universe is fully known,
  so an unresolvable `require` is a hard error, and stdlib features need
  their `require` just as in CRuby.
- **C5 — types cross package boundaries.** Inference runs over the spliced
  whole program; a package's poly-dispatch arms must be instantiation-gated
  by what the *application* constructs (open work), and a package may pin
  its public surface with `.rbs` sidecars.

## 4. Requirements

### R1 — separation of layers

| layer | contents | ships with | user-visible? |
|---|---|---|---|
| runtime | `sp_*.c/h`, archives | the compiler | never edited, not require-able |
| stdlib | require-gated features (`set`, `erb`, `json`, …) | the compiler | via `require`, no manifest entry |
| packages | everything else | fetched/vendored per project | via `require` + manifest entry |

The boundary is directory-level and implemented: `lib/` holds runtime C
only, and the bundled pure-Ruby stdlib (`set`, `erb`, `optparse`,
`forwardable`, plus the `stringio`/`strscan` marker shims) lives as
pre-installed packages under `packages/<name>/` -- each an ordinary package with
a `spin.toml`, proving the format on the compiler's own stdlib. The
compiler resolves `require` against `packages/` beside its runtime (repo and
installed tree alike, through symlinked invocation). Packages-only
directories: `packages/<name>/` (pre-installed),
`vendor/packages/<name>-<version>/` in a project,
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/spin/packages/<name>-<version>/` for fetches.

### R2 — package format (implemented)

A package is a directory, typically a git repo named `spinel-<name>` by
publishing convention; the package *name* carries no prefix because the name is
the `require` string. There are no per-language role directories: **role is
carried by extension and the package root is the require root**. `.rb` compiles
and defines the require namespace (`mypkg.rb`, subfeatures under `mypkg/`),
`.rbs` is an optional sidecar, `.c`/`.h` are carried native sources (R6).
Reserved directory names, excluded from the require namespace: `test/`,
`bin/`, `build/`, `vendor/`.

**Executables.** Each `bin/<name>.rb` is an executable and its own
whole-program compile root, spliced with the package's library sources and
resolved dependencies (cargo's `src/bin/*.rs` shape). **An application is a
package with executables** — same manifest, no separate project kind, and the
`[package]` identity table is optional for applications (name defaults to the
directory basename; publishing is what makes identity mandatory).
Dependents of a package never compile its `bin/`.

**Tests.** Each top-level `test/*.rb` is one test program through exactly
the `bin/` mechanics. Pass/fail is the compiler-repo oracle convention: a
committed `.expected` snapshot diffs against stdout; with no snapshot the
same file runs under `ruby` and diffs directly — the subset-parity check.
`spin test --regen` refreshes snapshots. Subdirectories of `test/` hold
`require_relative` helpers, not entries.

**Manifest** (`spin.toml`) is TOML and never executable: fetching or
vendoring a package runs no package code, and compilation of package C happens only
while building a dependent application. Implemented fields: `[package]
name`/`version`, `[dependencies]`, `[[build]]` + `[native] libs` +
`[features] default` (declared native build steps, R10). *Still
specification:* `[dev-dependencies]`, `provides` (feature names beyond the
package's own), `spinel` (compiler version constraint — reserved until the
toolchain is versioned), `[native]` cflags and bare `-lLIB` entries (carried
C needs no manifest entry; external installed libraries use the `ffi_lib`
DSL in the Ruby source), and `[build] spinel-flags`.

### R3 — consumer surface (implemented)

- `spin.toml` declares dependencies; sources are an index constraint string,
  `{ git = URL[, ref = R] }`, or `{ path = DIR }`.
- `spin.lock` records the machine-resolved result: exact versions including
  transitive dependencies, full commit SHAs for git/index sources.
  Reproducibility matters more than in CRuby: under whole-program inference
  a dependency bump can change whether the application *compiles*.
  Applications commit it; libraries do not. Absent a lock, builds resolve
  from the manifest (deterministic — see R5/MVS).
- In code, consumers write `require "name"` — nothing else. Resolution
  order: runtime-native feature → stdlib → project packages → `-I` roots.
- The zero-manifest escape hatch stays: hand-written `spinel -I` invocations
  have identical semantics; a manifest is only needed for
  versioned/fetched dependencies.

### R4 — resolution & versioning semantics

- Flat namespace; **one version of a package per application** (two copies of
  the same classes are a whole-program conflict, not an isolation feature).
- The dependency graph is walked transitively (a fetched package's own
  `[dependencies]` resolves too) and must be acyclic.
- *Still specification:* feature-namespace ownership enforcement (two packages
  providing overlapping features as a named resolution error), and
  undeclared-cross-package-require checking below resolution granularity — the
  latter needs per-root provenance that plain `-I` does not carry, layered
  on top of `-I` when it moves into the compiler.

### R5 — distribution (implemented through the index)

- **Phase 1: no registry.** Local paths + git URLs pinned by the lockfile
  SHA. `spin vendor` copies the resolved tree into `vendor/packages/`;
  `SPIN_OFFLINE=1` builds from cache/vendor only. Vendored trees are
  read-only inputs.
- **Phase 2: an index, not a server** (implemented): a git repository —
  <https://github.com/matz/spin-index> by default, `SPIN_INDEX`
  overrides, `file://` works — mapping names to repos and releases. One
  TOML file per package, read by the same reader as `spin.toml`:

  ```toml
  # packages/<name>.toml
  name = "ansi"
  repo = "https://github.com/x/spinel-ansi"

  [[release]]
  version = "1.2.0"
  ref = "a94a8fe5cc..."   # full commit SHA in `repo`
  ```

- **Name policy**: same name as a rubygems.org gem means "the same library,
  possibly a subset-compatible port"; divergent forks rename
  (`foo-spinel`). The probe corpus is the intended seed for the index
  (coordination still open).
- `spin publish` (implemented): validates identity + a pushed,
  version-consistent release commit, runs `spin test` as a hard gate (R8's
  spirit ahead of its metadata), then writes `packages/<name>.toml` and submits
  -- a gh-driven fork + PR when `gh` exists, printed instructions
  otherwise, or a direct push with `--direct` for index write access. The
  GitHub ssh remote form normalizes to https; file:// and local-path repos
  are refused (consumers must be able to fetch). Same-name/different-repo
  is rejected per the name policy. No tarballs, no accounts, no yank
  (removals are hand-written index PRs).

**Selection is MVS** (decided, implemented): among releases admitted by the
constraint (`~>` pessimistic, `>=`, exact, `*`), every package resolves to the
*lowest* admissible version.

- Deterministic without a lockfile — which is what makes `spin.lock`
  droppable for libraries instead of load-bearing.
- No SAT solving. Constraint gathering is first-encounter: a later
  conflicting constraint on an already-resolved package is an error, not a
  re-solve.
- Not auto-riding the newest release is intentional under whole-program
  inference; upgrades are opt-in and diffable.

Order of authority: `spin.lock` when it satisfies the manifest (a pinned
version that no longer satisfies a changed constraint is reselected with a
warning, and the next `spin lock` rewrites the pin); `vendor/packages/` then the
cache for sources; path deps always read live and are recorded unpinned.
Fetch materializes the exact release SHA — direct SHA fetch with a
full-clone + checkout fallback — and dies on mismatch. *Still
specification:* `spin lock --update` and `--frozen` (CI mode).

### R6 — C in packages (implemented)

- Carried C is discovered by extension: every `.c` in the package tree (outside
  `build/`, `vendor/`, `test/`) compiles into the shared cache
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/spin/native/<package>-<version>-<cc>/` — never into the
  package tree — and the objects reach the compiler via its repeatable
  `--link` flag; `spinel` itself never compiles package C. Objects rebuild when
  any of the package's `.c`/`.h` is newer; the package tree and the compiler's
  runtime headers are on the include path; `CC` selects the toolchain.
- The second shape, FFI to an external installed library, stays on the
  Ruby-side `ffi_lib`/`ffi_func` DSL (its SPINEL_LINK/SPINEL_CFLAGS markers
  already reach the link line). In-TU splicing of carried C is a possible
  future optimization behind the same declaration, not a third shape.
- *Still specification:* the `spinel/runtime.h` umbrella defining the
  stable public sp_ surface for carried C; today package C sees the same
  headers as the generated TU, with no compatibility promise on internals.

### R7 — type inference across packages

- Package sources are spliced and inferred with the application (C1); no
  pre-compiled types. `.rbs` sidecars pin public surfaces via the existing
  `--rbs` machinery. Diagnostics carry file:line positions through the
  `#line` machinery.
- *Open:* instantiation-gating of package-contributed poly-dispatch arms
  (an application that never constructs a package class should not pay for
  it — also the recovery path for the gate-flip's optcarrot cost).

### R8 — compatibility as metadata (implemented, SHA-versioned)

The toolchain version is the compiler's build revision — `spinel
--version` prints the git SHA embedded at build time — which unblocks R8
without deciding semver. Index package files carry flat `[[probe]]` records
(version, spinel = build SHA, result, detail, date): `spin publish`
appends a pass for the publishing build automatically (its hard test gate
just ran), and reprobe sweeps can append fails. Resolution surfaces them
before fetching: a fail recorded against the exact current build warns
"recorded FAILING with this compiler build", any newest-fail warns
generically, and neither blocks — the build is the final answer. Semver
toolchain constraints (`spinel = "~> x.y"` in the manifest) still await
real versioning.

### R9 — tooling: `spin`, a separate project tool (implemented)

The compiler CLI stays gcc-like: sources + `-I` roots in, binary out, no
network, no manifest knowledge, no state. `spin` owns everything stateful —
manifest editing, resolution, fetching, vendoring, invoking the compiler —
and every command works offline given a populated cache or vendor tree. No
daemon; no per-machine state outside `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/spin/`.

- `spin` is written in Spinel and ships beside the compiler (`make
  bin/spin`), dogfooding the language and the package format. Its dependencies
  are stdlib-only; its TOML reader (`tools/spin/toml.rb`, string-only
  storage, `[table]`/`[[table]]`/inline tables) is the intended seed of a
  future `toml` stdlib feature.
- Subcommands on the compiler CLI were considered and rejected: `spinel
  build` is ambiguous against `spinel build.rb`, and the compiler binary
  should not carry TOML/git/network code.
- Compiler interface: one `-I` per resolved package in resolution order, plus
  `-I <root>`, plus `--link <obj>` per cached native object, plus
  `SPINEL_REQUIRE_GATE=1`. An unresolved-`require` compile error is wrapped
  with the `spin add` hint that would fix it.
- Known name collisions, accepted: Fermyon's wasm tool and the SPIN model
  checker also install `spin`; distro packages may need a `spinel-spin`
  package name even though the binary stays `spin`.

### R10 — declared native build steps (implemented; #1820)

A package vendoring an external project with its own build system (cmake,
make) — ggml is the driving case — cannot be expressed as carried C (R6's
per-file `CC` has no configure step, per-arch flags, or nvcc). `[[build]]`
declares the step instead of running arbitrary tasks:

```toml
[[build]]                        # repeatable (ggml + a shim archive = two)
workdir   = "vendor/ggml"        # read-only input; the build runs in a scratch copy
patches   = ["patches/*.patch"]  # applied to the scratch copy (patch -p1)
command   = "cmake -B . ... && cmake --build ."
artifacts = ["libggml.a"]        # verified after the run; missing = failure
features  = ["cuda"]             # optional gate; off unless in [features] default

[native]
libs = ["${build.out}/libggml.a"]   # artifacts reach the R6 --link surface
```

- **When**: only while building a dependent application (`spin
  build`/`run`/`test`); `spin fetch`/`vendor` execute nothing, preserving
  R2. The same package works as the build root (its own `bin/`) and as a
  library dependency.
- **Consent, never silent** (deliberately unlike cargo's `build.rs`):
  `--allow-native-build` (one run), `SPIN_ALLOW_NATIVE_BUILD=1` (CI),
  `spin trust <name>` (recorded in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/spin/trust`), or —
  on an interactive terminal — an `Allow? [y/N/always]` prompt (`always`
  records the trust entry). A non-interactive build never waits on a
  prompt: it refuses with those options. A cached artifact skips consent —
  the consented command already ran on this machine.
- **Cache**: artifacts land in the shared native cache keyed by content
  (workdir tree hash + patch bytes + command + artifacts + toolchain +
  enabled features). A source or patch change moves the key and rebuilds;
  unchanged steps are reused across consumer projects with no
  build-system run.
- **Link**: `[[build]]` only *produces* artifacts. Linking stays on the
  existing surface — `[native] libs` entries, `${build.out}` expanded,
  flow into the compiler's repeatable `--link` (which accepts archives);
  R6 gains no third link shape. An entry whose artifact was
  feature-skipped drops out of the link line.
- **Features**: a `[[build]]` entry gated with `features = ["cuda"]` runs
  when the feature is in the package's own `[features] default` set or
  enabled by the consuming application's manifest: `dep = { path = "..",
  features = ["cuda"] }`, written by `spin add <name> --features cuda`.
  Cargo-style, the manifest is the source of truth and the lock stays
  resolution-only (Cargo.lock records no features either). Root-level
  enablement only; transitive feature unification is out of scope. The
  recommended packaging convention is cargo's `-sys` shape: a leaf package
  carrying the vendored tree, the `[[build]]` entries, and the raw
  `ffi_*` declarations.

## 5. Project model

- **Project root** = the nearest ancestor directory containing `spin.toml`
  (upward walk; commands run from any subdirectory).
- Build artifacts are per-project and disposable: `build/bin/<target>`,
  `build/test/<name>` (`spin clean` removes `build/`). `spin` writes
  nowhere else in the project except `spin.toml` (`add`/`remove`),
  `spin.lock`, and `vendor/packages/`.
- Rebuild tracking is the newest-input-mtime of the project and its
  dependency trees (`.rb`/`.rbs`/`.c`/`.h`/`spin.toml` plus the compiler
  binary) against each output — a flat input set; there is deliberately no
  per-file dependency graph, because type specialization spans every
  source. *Aspiration:* content-hash stamps (the compiler-repo scheme)
  instead of mtimes. Package C is cached across projects (R6); `spin` runs no
  *arbitrary* build tasks (no rake surface) — a package's *declared,
  consented* native build steps are the one exception (R10), and projects
  with bespoke steps beyond that call `spin` from their own build system.
- Output: one line per phase; `spin list --json` / `spin tree --json` are
  the machine surface. *Still specification:* `-q`/`-v`, distinct exit
  codes (currently 0/1), test parallelism (`-j`),
  `spin clean --cache`, and `spin remove` refusing while another dependency
  still requires the package. `spin install` (implemented) copies built `bin/`
  executables to `$XDG_BIN_HOME` / `~/.local/bin` (`--prefix` overrides,
  `--uninstall` removes); installing a tool *from the index* is
  deliberately a separate, deferred verb so the rubygems reading of
  `install <name>` never collides with `bin/<name>`.

## 6. spin.lock

TOML, one table per resolved package, written by `spin add`/`remove`/`lock`,
consumed by every build; something you *diff*, never edit:

```toml
[lock.ansi]
version = "0.1.0"        # from the package's own spin.toml at the pinned ref
git = "https://…"        # git and index sources: repo URL
ref = "<commit SHA>"     # always a full SHA, never a branch name

[lock.local]
version = "0.0.0"
path = "../spinel-local" # path deps are recorded but never pinned
```

Resolution against a lock is **verification, not selection**: the lock pins
git/index sources to their SHAs; constraints are re-checked against it, and
only a constraint the pin no longer satisfies triggers reselection (with a
warning). Content integrity rides on the git SHA; tree hashing for
non-git transports would arrive with any such transport.

## 7. Non-goals

- **Runtime loading** of any kind (no dlopen, no late require).
- **Binary package distribution** (no ABI exists; C1).
- **Side-by-side versions** of one package in one application (R4).
- **Install-time code execution** (R2); packages compute nothing at fetch.
- **A hosted registry service** (the git index instead).
- Replacing FFI: it remains the boundary to *external* native libraries.

## 8. Implementation notes

`tools/spin.rb` (+ `tools/spin/toml.rb`), compiled to `bin/spin`;
`tools/spin_e2e.sh` is the hermetic end-to-end check (`make spin-check`,
part of `make check`): scaffold, path/git/index deps, MVS, lock schema,
add/remove/search, tests in both oracle modes, carried C with cache reuse
and staleness, the require gate, vendor and offline with and without a
lock.

Being written in the subset, spin also serves as a trap log; the ones its
code works around deliberately (see the comments in place): nil-carrying
`String` returns flow through `""` instead (no first-class `string?`),
arrays-of-tuples and `[]` accumulator arguments go poly-array and poison
string parameters downstream (tab/newline-packed record strings instead),
`\0` cannot separate C-string keys (`\x01` instead), and a method named
`json_str` collides with the runtime's `sp_json_str` symbol.

## 9. Open points

1. **Stdlib carve-out** (R1): which require-gated features move from the
   compiler tree into pre-installed packages first (`erb`/`optparse`/`set` are
   the easy three; `json`/`stringio` are C-backed and exercise R6), and the
   `packages/` directory itself.
2. **Index seeding** from the probe corpus, and coordination with the
   community spin packages compatibility catalog (who owns the name registry).
3. **Toolchain versioning**: the `spinel` manifest constraint, R8 probe
   warnings, and spin↔spinel skew handling all wait on the compiler
   carrying a version.
4. R4 enforcement below resolution granularity (per-root provenance on top
   of `-I`).
5. Native-cache eviction (currently: never).
6. `spin lock --update`, `--frozen`, `--dev`/`[dev-dependencies]`,
   index-install (a `spin get`-style verb), `-q`/`-v`/`-j`,
   `spin clean --cache`.
7. Transitive feature unification for R10 (a dependency's dependency
   enabling a feature); consumer enablement is implemented for the root
   application's direct dependencies.
