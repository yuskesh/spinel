Spinel schedules Ruby `Thread`s as green threads over `N` OS workers with real
parallelism and no GVL. The design grew in phases; the section numbers below
(§5, design 3.x, design 8, Appendix B) are the ones the commit history and the
source comments refer to.

## Green threads on the fiber substrate

A Ruby `Thread` is a green thread (`sp_thread`) wrapping an `sp_Fiber` that the
codegen builds **exactly like a `Fiber.new` block** — the capture / self / cell
machinery is shared, and the block's result lands in `fiber->yielded_value`.
This is why `Thread` and `Fiber` share `emit_fiber_new`: a thread is a fiber
plus a scheduling record.

`sp_thread` (in `sp_sched.h`) carries the fiber, the spawn arg, the return
value / unhandled-exception triple, the run state
(`RUNNABLE`/`RUNNING`/`BLOCKED`/`DEAD`), the run-queue and wait-list links, the
joiner list, thread-local storage, and the sleep/I/O parking fields. Threads are
kept alive by the scheduler's live-thread registry (`all_next`/`all_prev`), so
the `Mutex`/`Queue`/`ConditionVariable` structs never need to GC-scan their
owner/waiter pointers — the registry already roots them.

## Phase 0: cooperative core (N = 1)

The starting point (still the `SPINEL_WORKERS=1` model). The main program runs
on the **root fiber** and *is* the scheduler hub: it executes top-level code
directly and, whenever it blocks (`#join` / `#value` / `Thread.pass`) or at
program exit (`sp_sched_drain`), it pumps a FIFO run queue of runnable green
threads. A spawned thread yields by transferring back to the root fiber, where
the pump loop — or the fiber trampoline, on termination — resumes it. With a
single worker there is no concurrent heap mutation, so the GC and allocator are
untouched.

## Workers and run queues (design 3.x, Appendix B)

- **Helper OS workers.** `sp_worker_count()` = `min(online cores,
  SPINEL_WORKERS)`, clamped to `SP_MAX_WORKERS` (256). Each worker runs a
  root-fiber pump loop; worker 0 is the main thread, whose native stack is its
  root fiber.
- **Per-worker local run queues + a global queue (design 3.1).** A spawned or
  woken thread lands on the **global** run queue `g_grq`; each worker also has a
  **local** queue `g_lrq[wid]` for rerun locality. A worker picks
  **local-first, then global, then steals** one runnable thread from a busier
  worker. Work stealing keeps all workers fed without a single hot queue.
- **One lock.** A single mutex guards all scheduler/sync metadata (the run
  queues, the live-thread registry, wait lists). `g_runnable` counts threads
  sitting in any queue.
- **Off-cpu handshake.** `off_cpu` / `wake_pending` prevent a waker from
  enqueueing a thread onto a second worker while it is still mid-context-switch
  off its first worker's stack.

## Stop-the-world GC

Parallel workers mutate the heap, so collection is **stop-the-world at a
safepoint**. The codegen emits, at loop back-edges of a threaded program,
`if (SP_UNLIKELY(sp_safepoint_flag)) sp_safepoint();` (design 5.1). The flag is
set only in the threaded runtime while a collector has requested STW; at N=1 it
is never set, so the poll is a single predicted-not-taken load. It is declared
unconditionally (not under `SP_THREADS`) so a threaded program's generated C
still compiles against the single-threaded archive (e.g. the test harness's
manual `cc` path), where the poll is an inert no-op.

`sp_safepoint()` parks the worker at the GC barrier. A worker parking there also
runs `sp_safepoint_publish_hook` (when the TU installs one) to publish its
per-worker in-flight roots that live in the generated TU — pending exception
objects and proc-return home values — onto its shadow stack so the collector
marks them. The GC mark hook also roots every worker's root fiber and every live
green thread from the registry.

## The monitor thread (sysmon, §5)

A dedicated monitor thread ("sysmon"), off the workers' backs, has three jobs:

1. **Wake sleepers.** `sp_sched_sleep(seconds)` parks the calling thread with a
   `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` `wake_deadline` and frees its OS worker; the monitor wakes
   it when the deadline passes. (In the single-threaded build this falls back to
   a plain blocking sleep.)
2. **Timeslice preemption.** The monitor watches how long each worker has run
   its current green thread (`g_wslot[]`, re-checked every `SP_PREEMPT_TICK` =
   5 ms). Past the ~10 ms quantum it sets the thread's `preempt_request` and
   signals the worker with `g_preempt_sig` (`SIGURG`, overridable via
   `SPINEL_PREEMPT_SIGNAL`). The thread yields at its next safepoint poll —
   cooperative preemption, so a region with no poll is not yet interruptible.
3. **Scheduler-aware I/O (design 8).** `sp_sched_wait_io(fd, events)` parks a
   green thread on an fd (POLLIN/POLLOUT), freeing its worker; the monitor
   rebuilds a `poll()` set (`g_pfds`) from the I/O-waiter list each tick and
   wakes the thread when the fd is ready. A self-pipe (`g_sysmon_pipe`) wakes the
   monitor out of `poll()` when the wait set changes.

The monitor idles on `g_sysmon_cv` when there is nothing to watch and is woken
via `sp_sysmon_wake()` (condvar signal, or a write to the self-pipe if it is
blocked in `poll()`).

## Synchronization primitives

All three park the calling green thread (yielding to the scheduler) rather than
busy-waiting, and hold their waiters on intrusive wait lists:

- **`Mutex`** — non-recursive: an `owner` pointer (NULL = unlocked) and a
  `waiters` list. `#unlock` hands off to the next waiter.
- **`Queue` / `SizedQueue`** — a ring buffer with `pop_waiters` (blocked on
  empty) and `push_waiters` (blocked on a full `SizedQueue`, `max > 0`). This is
  the producer/consumer hand-off the lazy Phase-0 model could not express.
- **`ConditionVariable`** — `#wait` releases the mutex, parks on the condvar's
  `waiters`, and re-acquires the mutex on wake; `#signal` / `#broadcast` unpark.

## Status vs. the source

Everything above is implemented on `master`. The near-term rough edges tracked
in [../limitations.md](../limitations.md) (the `Thread` row):

- Preemption is **cooperative at safepoints**, not fully async: a long region
  inside a single runtime call with no poll yields only when the call returns.
  Fully signal-interrupted preemption of such regions is future work.
- Per-worker allocation (TLAB) is not yet in; allocation goes through the shared
  heap under the scheduler lock's coordination.

When updating this file, keep the `Thread` row in `../limitations.md` and the
summary in `../thread.md` in sync — those are the user-facing surfaces.
