  /* The budget is what may be ALLOCATED before the next collection, and what
     pays for it is what that collection COSTS. A collection marks BOTH heaps,
     so an object budget taken from the object live set alone is priced off
     the wrong quantity: rubys measured a ladder where the string live set
     grows 26x while the object set grows 4.9x, the collection rate falls with
     the object set, and the mark per request rises 2.5x (#4384).
     This is the default. SPINEL_GC_OBJ_BUDGET=obj restores pricing it off
     the object heap alone.

     It shipped opt-in first, because the argument was sound and the evidence
     was not: what had been measured at +47% was a fixed 16 MB FLOOR, which is
     a different policy -- a floor stops the budget getting small, this makes
     it proportional. rubys then ran both, on two emits at two concurrencies,
     twice each. Pricing it off the walk reproduces the floor's throughput
     (+26% to +44%) at within 5-10% of the floor's memory, and the reason to
     prefer it is neither of those: it settles at 70-78 MB where the floor
     pins 128, and at 227-253 MB where the floor is too small, so it is right
     at both ends of a 3.3x concurrency swing. A fixed number cannot be.
     Our own 61 benchmarks and optcarrot are neutral on it: same wall, RSS
     within 0.5%, fps inside its spread.
     What it cost, before the gate below: it widened the budget by the mark
     set whether or not the mark was what the program paid for. Two synthetics
     here that hold a large live string set while collecting cheaply paid
     memory for nothing. */

  /* ---- the gate: widen by the share of the collection the MARK is ----

     alpha is that share, and the budget widens by alpha x the string live
     set. A program whose collections are nearly all mark gets `walk`; one
     whose collections are nearly all sweep gets `obj`; the two synthetics and
     rubys' server sit at opposite ends of it rather than needing different
     defaults.

     COUNTS, not bytes. A cost ratio taken per byte does not carry between
     programs: a cache of large strings and a churn of small arrays hold the
     same megabytes with slot counts fifty times apart, which is how the first
     attempt at this failed (#4384). The sweep's cost is per SLOT and the
     mark's is per LIVE OBJECT, so counted, the coefficients are properties of
     this code rather than of a program's allocation sizes.

     And the coefficient is an ORDER, not a measurement. Measured here, mark
     is ~360-560 ns an object and sweep is ~8 ns a slot serially against ~120
     ns across eight workers, where the parked-worker coordination and the
     string sweep fold in. Writing those numbers down would pin this machine's
     ratio into the collector and be wrong on the next one. Written as the
     order they sit at -- Cm/Cs is about 64 serially and about 4 in parallel --
     the arithmetic is a shift and the answer barely moves: on the pair that
     motivated the gate, the measured coefficients give alpha 0.012 and 0.57,
     the orders give 0.016 and 0.55. The decision was never close enough for
     the precision to matter, which is the argument for not claiming it. */
