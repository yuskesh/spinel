   (marshal, pack, json, ...) can therefore allocate GC-tracked strings directly
   without #including spinel_rt.h and inheriting its per-TU `static` heap state
   (which would otherwise create a second, never-swept string heap and leak).

   The hot allocators stay `static inline` here so each including TU still
   inlines them over the shared extern state -- the same shape sp_gc_alloc
   already uses for the extern sp_gc_heap / sp_gc_bytes object heap. */
