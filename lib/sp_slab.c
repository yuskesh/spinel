/* sp_slab.c -- size-class slab allocation for GC objects and heap strings,
 * with the generations and the mark kept in bitmaps beside the chunks.
 *
 * Every object and every heap string used to be one malloc and, when it
 * died, one free. On a server that allocates nine thousand of them per
 * request from thirty workers, that was 40% of the CPU: glibc's arena locks
 * and consolidation on the way in, and a sweep that handed every dead block
 * back through free() on the way out, cold, from whichever thread ran the
 * collection. Nothing a faster general allocator fixes -- tcmalloc measured
 * the same -- because the cost is the per-block call and the cross-thread
 * free, not the arithmetic.
 *
 * Here a block is a slot in a 16 KB chunk of one size class, and what the
 * collector knows about a slot lives in seven bitmaps kept in the arena's
 * metadata chunks, one bit per slot each, never in the slot itself:
 *
 *   young[0], young[1]  allocated in the epoch of that parity (see below)
 *   old                 promoted
 *   mark                reached by this cycle's mark
 *   fin                 an object whose death runs a finalizer or recycler
 *   str                 a heap string (its bytes count on the string side)
 *   pin                 never freed by a sweep: a frozen heap string, a
 *                       container payload, a dead header parked on its
 *                       pool (the last two are in no generation at all and
 *                       die by an explicit free, or come back by a relive)
 *
 * A slot is free when it is in no generation and not pinned (young[0],
 * young[1], old, pin all clear), and allocation is a find-first-zero over
 * those four words and one or into the current epoch's young word (atomic
 * when threaded; single-threaded the words are plain). That replaced the
 * per-chunk free list linked through the blocks, and the reason is the
 * sweep: with the list, a sweep touched the header of every dead object to
 * unlink it and to thread the free list through it, and on a server that
 * churns a hundred megabytes of small blocks between two collections that
 * was a stream of cache misses worth a fifth of the process. A sweep here
 * reads the bitmaps of a chunk -- a few cache lines for sixteen kilobytes of
 * slots -- and never the slots, except the dead ones whose `fin` bit says a
 * finalizer has to run.
 *
 * The EPOCH is what tells the generation a concurrent sweep is reclaiming
 * from what the running program has allocated since the barrier: the
 * collector flips the parity under the barrier, so everything allocated
 * from then on goes into the other young bitmap, and the sweep frees from
 * the one that stopped growing. The mark promotes what it reaches -- it
 * sets `old` on a young survivor, as the header's `old` bit is set there
 * too -- so after the mark the swept young word is exactly the dead plus
 * the promoted, and clearing it whole is the sweep's write.
 *
 * Every chunk lives inside one address range reserved at startup (16 GB of
 * untouched, uncommitted pages; smaller where the system refuses), so a free
 * tells a slab block from a malloc'd one by a range check, and a slot finds
 * its chunk by masking its address. The range is handed out in 4 MB arenas
 * whose first chunk holds the arena's chunk headers and whose next seven
 * hold the bitmaps, so a released chunk keeps no resident page at all. At
 * the end of a full cycle every chunk that is entirely free, beyond a small
 * reserve per worker, is given back to the OS with madvise and re-carved
 * from scratch when next used; that is what malloc_trim did for these
 * blocks, at a syscall per idle chunk instead of a walk of thirty arenas.
 *
 * A chunk belongs to one worker for allocation and no other worker
 * allocates from it, and every chunk a worker owns is on its owned list,
 * which is what its sweep walks. Frees come from anywhere -- a sweeper
 * thread, a finalizer on another worker, the explicit free of a payload --
 * and are atomic bit clears; the one structure they share with the owner
 * beyond the bitmaps is the owner's available list, pushed with the same
 * compare-and-swap the owner pops with.
 *
 * SPINEL_GC_SLAB=0 turns this off and every block is a malloc again, which
 * is the configuration ASAN wants: a slab hides a use-after-free from it.
 * It is on by default whatever the process's malloc (it used to default off
 * under jemalloc; see sp_slab_jemalloc_present for why that changed). */
