# race-check.sh -- run a threaded spinel program under a data-race detector.
#
# The normal test gate links the single-threaded archive even for threaded tests
# (test-run does its own cc with libspinel_rt.a and no -DSP_THREADS), so it never
# exercises the mt archive's parallel paths. This compiles the program through
# the real spinel driver (so it links the threaded runtime, libspinel_rt_mt.a,
# plus -lpthread) and runs it under Valgrind/Helgrind, which reports any data
# race on the shared GC heap, the thread registry, or the run queue. This is the
# Phase 1 (N>1) validation gate.
#
# Helgrind, not ThreadSanitizer: TSan reserves fixed virtual-address ranges for
# its shadow memory and FATALs ("unexpected memory mapping") on the fiber stacks
# that the green-thread scheduler mmaps -- the per-fiber __tsan_switch_to_fiber
# instrumentation in sp_fiber.c handles the cooperative switch, but not the stack
# placement. Helgrind instruments dynamically and has no such range restriction,
# so it runs the fiber program directly. (TSan can be revisited once fiber stacks
# are allocated in a TSan-tolerated range; the tsan-archive target still builds.)
#
# Usage: scripts/race-check.sh prog.rb [prog args...]
#   SPINEL=path/to/spinel  to override the compiler binary
#   SPINEL_WORKERS=N       to set the worker count (once N>1 lands)
