 # Returns 1 if @nd_block[nid] is a literal BlockNode (do/end body),

 # &block-forwarding call sites (literal block vs. `&proc_var`).

 # Returns the inner expression of a BlockArgumentNode whose payload
 # is a captured proc local (the `&block` form). Returns -1 for
 # absent block-arg, or for shapes the codegen doesn't yet forward
 # — `&:sym` (SymbolNode) and `&nil` (NilNode), which would need
 # symbol-to-proc / nil-as-no-block lowering. Call sites fall
 # through to the no-block path in those cases.

 # Resolves the call-site block-forwarding expression: returns the C
 # expression for the proc to forward at a `&block`-taking call site
 # (a literal block compiles to sp_proc_new(...); a `&proc_var` is
 # the captured `sp_Proc *` local), or "" if the call site provides
 # no block.

 # Returns the body node id for class ci's midx'th method, or -1
 # if midx is out of range or the body id is invalid. Centralises
 # the @cls_meth_bodies[ci].split(";")[midx].to_i parse so detectors
 # don't have to inline it.

 # Returns the name of the class method's single proc-typed param
 # (its `&block` slot), or "" if the signature isn't exactly one
 # proc param. Used by detectors that match the
 # `def m(&b); ...; end` shape (instance_eval trampoline today;
 # extensible to instance_exec, tap, etc.).

 # Detects the exact arity-0 instance_eval trampoline shape:
 # `def m(&b); instance_eval(&b); end`. Returns 1 when the
 # (ci, midx) method body is a single CallNode of `instance_eval`
 # forwarded the method's sole proc-typed param via &-arg, 0
 # otherwise. Spinel inlines these at the call site (yield-style)
 # with self rebound to the receiver — full Ruby instance_eval is
 # dynamic, but this AOT compromise covers the common DSL-trampoline
 # shape. Anything wider falls through to today's silent no-op.

 # Sentinel value for Stage 2 switch dispatch. Each module's index in

 # Look up the return type of a `<class_or_module>.<mname>`
 # singleton method, walking @meth_* (module / synthetic top-level
 # form) and @cls_cmeth_* (in-class `def self.X`). Returns "" when
 # the method isn't registered. Used by the module-dispatch ternary
 # default-tail and per-arm boxing paths.


 # Print a stderr warning the first time we see an unresolved call to
 # `mname` with the given receiver-type tag. Subsequent identical
 # warnings are suppressed so a silent-fallthrough call inside a hot
 # loop emits one line, not a torrent. The warning is informational
 # only — codegen continues and emits `0` for the call's C expression
 # (the historical silent-no-op behaviour) so existing tests/benches
 # whose outputs happen to coincide with `0` keep compiling.

 # Same dedupe pattern as warn_unresolved_call but for unknown
 # ConstantReadNode names. Reuses @unresolved_call_warnings so a
 # single program with both an undefined method and an undefined
 # constant produces two distinct warnings, not interleaved noise.

 # Walk every class's parent chain. A cycle anywhere on the chain is
 # a fatal program error: bail with a clear message instead of letting
 # the recursive helpers loop forever. Self-inheritance (`class A < A`)
 # is detected as the trivial 1-step cycle.

 # Copy each inherited class method (def self.<m> on a parent
 # class) into every subclass's @cls_cmeth_* tables so the
 # subclass gets its own synthetic copy. Each copy reuses the
 # parent's AST body id; emit_class_methods then re-compiles the
 # body under the subclass's @current_class_idx, so a bare `new`
 # inside the body resolves to the subclass's constructor.
 #
 # Run after class collection so all parents are populated, and
 # before infer_all_returns / call-site widening so the synthetic
 # entries participate in regular type inference.

 # this class, allocated by sp_Method_new and walked by the auto-
 # generated sp_Method_gc_scan. .
 #
 # The two ivars:
 # - `@self_obj` typed `obj_Method`. Load-bearing hack: this type
 # makes ivar_is_gc_ptr true, which makes the auto-generated gc
 # scanner emit `sp_gc_mark(self->iv_self_obj)`. The actual
 # captured pointer is the bound receiver (any user class), cast
 # to `sp_Method *`. sp_gc_mark dispatches via the GC header's
 # `scan` field — set at the *bound receiver's* allocation time —
 # not via the static pointer type, so the cast is safe at the
 # GC level even though it's a type lie at the C level.
 # detect_method_taken_classes excludes the bound receiver's
 # class from value-type optimization so the captured pointer
 # never dangles (value-type instances live on the caller's
 # stack and would be reclaimed when the binding method returns).
 # - `@fn_ptr` typed `int`. Holds `(uintptr_t)&sp_<DefCls>_<mname>`
 # reinterpreted as mrb_int (int64_t — wide enough on every
 # target). The Method.call/[] codegen in compile_call_expr casts
 # it back to a function pointer of the right shape.

 # Bare `new(args)` inside a class method body widens the
 # subclass's `initialize` ptypes from this call's args.
 # scan_new_calls' generic `new` handler only fires when the
 # receiver is an explicit class constant (`Article.new(attrs)`);
 # the bare form has no receiver and would otherwise leave
 # `sp_Article_new(mrb_int)` called with `sp_SymStrHash *`.
 #
 # By the time this runs, propagate_inherited_class_methods has
 # already given each subclass its own copy of the inherited
 # cls method, with @cls_cmeth_ptypes widened from explicit
 # call sites. Walking each cls method body for bare `new(args)`
 # and unifying the matching `find_init_class(ci).initialize`
 # ptypes fills the gap. Args that read a cls-method local
 # resolve via the cls method's pnames/ptypes; other args fall
 # through to infer_type with @current_class_idx pinned so
 # @ivar refs in the args resolve against the right class.
 # Propagate ptypes from child#initialize to parent#initialize via
 # super calls. Without this, a `Sub.new(owner_obj)` site widens
 # `Sub#initialize`'s `_owner` param to `obj_<C>` correctly (via
 # the existing constructor branch in scan_new_calls), but the
 # body's bare `super` lowers to a C call against the parent's
 # `Base#initialize`, whose param ptype stays at the default
 # `mrb_int` because no call-site path widens the *parent's*
 # initialize through super. The C output then casts the typed
 # pointer to `mrb_int` at the super-call site, the parent's body's
 # `@owner = owner` records the int into the slot, and every
 # subsequent `@owner.<method>` dispatch on a child instance lands
 # on whatever class shares the int recv's cls_id — commonly the
 # wrong one.
 #
 # ForwardingSuperNode (bare `super`): forwards every param of the
 # current method by name. Unify the parent ptypes element-wise
 # against the child ptypes (capped at min length, so a wider
 # parent signature stays unwidened past the forwarded prefix).
 #
 # SuperNode (`super(arg1, arg2, …)`): explicit arg list. Each arg
 # might be a LocalVariableReadNode that points back at one of the
 # current method's params; if so, use the param's ptype to unify
 # at the super arg's position. Other shapes (literals, calls)
 # fall through to infer_type.

 # #482. A method with `def m(other = nil)` whose body does
 # `other[key]` (Hash-receiver index read) leaves `other` at the
 # `mrb_int` fallback when no caller passes a non-nil value. The
 # body's `other["key"]` then falls through to `[] on int` (emits 0),
 # the resulting local lands in a typed pointer field, and gcc fires
 # an int-to-pointer conversion error. Worse, `return if other.nil?`
 # / `if !v.nil?` collapse because spinel reasons about `mrb_int 0`
 # as `Integer 0` (`.nil?` -> FALSE), losing the nil-encoded semantics.
 #
 # Sibling to #447 (return-path back-prop). Fix here: when the body
 # uses an int-typed param with nil default as a String-keyed Hash
 # receiver, widen the param's stored type to `str_str_hash`. Spinel
 # already treats hash pointers as nullable, so the early-return /
 # nil-guard then survives DCE.

 # Body-side param narrowing (Stage 1 of the callee→caller direction
 # of type inference, complementing scan_new_calls' caller→callee
 # widening). For each method's params still typed at the default
 # `int`, walk the body for `param.<m>` calls. If <m> is defined
 # on exactly one user class (and isn't a common operator / built-
 # in-overlap method), the param's static type narrows to that
 # class. Conflicting strong signals leave the param at int.
 #
 # The narrow direction (int → obj_<C>) only fires when the caller-
 # side widening hasn't already pinned the param to a non-int type,
 # so it never overrides observation from a real call site. If a
 # later iteration's caller-side scan finds an actual int arg flowing
 # into this slot, unify_call_types will widen back to poly — net
 # effect no worse than skipping the narrow.
 #
 # Excluded method names cover operators (which user classes
 # routinely overload but built-in primitives also implement) and
 # the common Object/Enumerable surface (`length`, `each`, `to_s`,
 # ...) — when these match a user class they don't actually
 # discriminate from a built-in.

 # sp_RbVal) gets `void (*)(const char *, sp_RbVal, void *)` —
 # matching the emitted `_block(lv_k, lv_v, _benv)` call site.
 #
 # Called BEFORE the function's scope has been pushed, so
 # locally-declared vars referenced in yield args (`yield k, v`
 # where `k`, `v` were assigned from typed expressions) are not
 # in @scope_names. Run scan_locals on the body and push a
 # temporary scope so body_yield_arg_types' infer_type calls
 # resolve those reads. Re-runs at both forward-decl emit time
 # and impl emit time; results converge once @meth_* / @cls_*
 # tables stabilize through the type-inference fixpoint.

 # Walk `nid` for YieldNode, accumulating the per-position arg
 # type into `types`. Stops at nested DefNode boundaries (those

 # Same as method_yield_arity, but resolved through the class method
 # body table @cls_meth_bodies (parallel to @cls_meth_has_yield).

 # Comma-joined string of `arity` mrb_int slots — the variable-arity
 # portion of the `_block` function-pointer signature.

 # Returns 1 if the (ci, midx) method declares a `&block` parameter,
 # 0 otherwise. Ruby syntax requires `&block` to be the trailing
 # param, so we check only the last slot — a proc-typed slot in any
 # other position is a positional proc argument, not a block param.
 # Mirrors cls_method_has_yield: call sites use it to decide whether
 # to omit the trailing &block slot from default-padding.

 # Returns the name of a method's `&block` parameter (the trailing
 # proc-typed slot in pnames), or "" if the method doesn't take
 # one. Ruby syntax requires `&block` to be the trailing param, so
 # a proc-typed slot in any other position is a positional proc
 # argument. Mirrors cls_method_has_block_param's trailing-only

 # (b) Backward: if @meth_param_types[mi][k] has already been

 # and `arg` is a local with the empty flag, upgrade the

 #
 # - sp_Method (when the class is in scope): equal iff bound
 # receiver + fn_ptr match — covers `obj.method(:foo)` dedup.
 # - sp_IntArray (SP_BUILTIN_INT_ARRAY = -1): element-wise content
 # compare — covers `entries[[a, b]] ||= ...` array-keyed Hash
 # patterns.


 # Compile a node for use as a C scalar condition. Value-type objects
 # are passed by value (a struct), and C rejects them as scalars in

 # `_cap` struct so the body's emitted C can resolve `self->iv_X` and
 # `sp_<Class>_<method>(self)` call sites without the surrounding
 # method's `self` parameter.



 # Returns the C expression for a CallNode. Symmetric with
 # `infer_call_type` (which returns the call's C type) — see the

 # Branch order in this function mirrors infer_call_type's order so

 # Compile `recv[idx] OP= value` (IndexOperatorWriteNode).
 #
 # Emitted as a get-modify-set against the appropriate typed container,
 # in a block scope so that the receiver and index are each evaluated
 # exactly once. Falls through silently for receiver types we don't
 # handle yet — currently float_array, int_array, and the four numeric
 # hash variants. Compound-assign on string arrays / poly hashes / str
 # hashes is rarely useful and would need per-type semantics.

 # `obj.attr <op>= val` family helper -- builds the
 # temp-receiver-once C block for typed-instance receivers backed by
 # an attr_accessor (or struct field). For non-attr receivers, we
 # exit with a precise error rather than fall through to an
 # incorrect emission. The caller passes a fragment that takes the
 # temp variable name and returns the C body to execute.
 #
 # Spec note: even for the typed-attr-accessor case the receiver is
 # evaluated exactly ONCE -- the source `obj.bar += val` is
 # `tmp = obj; tmp.bar = tmp.bar + val`, NOT `obj.bar = obj.bar + val`.
 # The temp pattern matters when the receiver expression has side
 # effects (e.g. `next_holder().attr += 1`).

 # `a[i] &&= val` -- read once, conditionally write once. Mirrors
 # compile_index_op_assign's per-receiver-type dispatch but routes
 # the new value through a C `if (cur)` guard instead of an
 # arithmetic op. The temp pattern keeps `a` and `i` evaluated
 # exactly once, matching CRuby's `a[i] = a[i] && val` evaluation
 # order.

 # `a[i] ||= val` -- read once, write only if current is falsy.
 # Same C-truthy vs Ruby-truthy gap as the LocalVariable/Global/
 # Class compound forms (numeric 0 is C-falsy; documented in
 # test/global_var_or_write.rb). For string-valued slots (NULL
 # falsy, anything else truthy) the C and Ruby semantics agree.

 # Emit the get-then-set body for `recv[k] ||= v` against a
 # poly_poly_hash receiver and return the C name of the sp_RbVal temp
 # holding the resulting value (existing on hit, freshly-stored rhs on
 # miss). Caller is responsible for using or discarding the temp.

 # Same shape as `compile_poly_poly_index_or_assign_to_temp` for
 # sym_poly_hash / str_poly_hash receivers — the keys are bare
 # `sp_sym` / `const char *` (not boxed sp_RbVal) but the value
 # slot is poly so the get-then-set still pivots on the
 # `tag == SP_TAG_NIL` miss probe.

 # Box the rhs of an `||=` whose lhs is a poly-element slot. For
 # ArrayNode literals — `[]`, `[nil, nil]`, … — promote to
 # poly_array (boxed) so the slot carries a uniformly poly shape;
 # subsequent chain levels can then inspect the value's cls_id
 # against `SP_BUILTIN_POLY_ARRAY` reliably. Without the promote,
 # `[]` would lower to `sp_box_int_array(sp_IntArray_new())`, the
 # next chain level's `cls_id == POLY_ARRAY` check would fail, and
 # the back-set would skip silently. Non-ArrayNode rhs falls back
 # to the existing `box_expr_to_poly` machinery.

 # `recv[i] ||= v` against a typed-array receiver whose element
 # slot is a boxed sp_RbVal — i.e. poly_array. The miss probe is
 # the same `tag == SP_TAG_NIL` pivot used by the *_poly_hash
 # forms, but indexed access has two extra wrinkles:
 #
 # - the key must be in-bounds before `_get` is safe to call
 # (sp_PolyArray_get reads `data[i]` without a length check),
 # - on miss the slot may be beyond `len`, so before `_set` we
 # pad the array with nil entries up to `i` inclusive.
 #
 # Mirrors CRuby's `arr[i] = v` auto-grow semantics for the gap.
 # Scalar-element typed arrays (int_array, float_array, …) need a
 # different probe (out-of-bounds check, no SP_TAG_NIL) and are
 # not handled here; the caller falls back to the existing stmt
 # path for those.

 # `<poly>[i] ||= v` where the recv is an sp_RbVal carrying — at
 # runtime — a poly_array. Common in chains like
 # `(@h[k] ||= [])[i] ||= ...`: spinel types `(@h[k] ||= [])` as
 # poly because the hash leaf type is poly, and the inner `||=`
 # sees a poly recv even though the value is concretely a
 # poly_array.
 #
 # The miss probe needs an extra `tag == SP_TAG_OBJ &&
 # cls_id == SP_BUILTIN_POLY_ARRAY` guard so the runtime falls
 # through cleanly when the poly carries a non-array shape. The
 # body otherwise mirrors `compile_typed_array_index_or_assign_to_temp`.

 # Return a C expression that evaluates to the inspected form of `val`
 # (a value of inferred Ruby type `at`), following Ruby's Object#inspect
 # contract. Returns "" when `at` has no inspect implementation yet, so

 # `redo` label-stack helpers. Each loop emitter wraps its body

 # Emit the C label that `redo` jumps to. C requires labels to be
 # followed by a statement; `;` lets a subsequent `}` stay valid
 # even if the body is empty.

 # Supports range and all array-like types. After calling this helper,
 # the caller emits the block body and a closing '}'. idx_var holds

 # An empty `map {}` block yields nil per iteration in CRuby —
 # the result array's length still matches the receiver. Without
 # an explicit push the typed accumulator stays short and
 # downstream `.length` / `[i]` on the result is wrong. Push a
 # type-appropriate default (0 / 0.0 / "" / sp_box_nil) so
 # length is preserved across all map dispatches.












 # Replay all in-scope ensure bodies inline (innermost-first) ahead
 # of an early-exit `return`. Each ensure is popped from the stack
 # *before* its body is emitted, so a nested `return` inside the
 # ensure body sees only the *outer* ensures still active and
 # doesn't replay the same ensure recursively. Stack is restored
 # afterwards so the caller continues with the same view.
 #
 # @setjmp_depth is stashed to 0 during the replay because the
 # caller is responsible for emitting `sp_exc_top -= N` *once*
 # before the replays — a nested `return` inside an ensure body
 # would otherwise re-emit that decrement and over-pop the stack.

 # Emit the `sp_exc_top -= N;` that an early `return` needs in
 # order to leave sp_exc_top balanced. Called immediately before
 # `emit_ensure_replays` at every `return` emission site.










 # Tries the yield-method or instance_eval-trampoline dispatch
 # against a single class index. Returns 1 if dispatch fired (caller
 # should return immediately), 0 otherwise (caller falls through to
 # the next gate, e.g. parent class). Shared by the direct-class and
 # parent-class branches in compile_no_recv_call_expr.

 # Splice the statements of a block body in place with `self`
 # rebound to self_var (typed as cname). Saves and restores the
 # rebound-self ivars (@instance_eval_self_var / _type) so nested
 # splices compose. compile_no_recv_call_expr's instance_eval-self
 # branch reads these to dispatch receiverless calls inside the
 # splice against the rebound class. Reusable by future
 # rebind-and-splice features (e.g. instance_exec, tap-shape
 # trampolines).

 # Inlines a `recv.m { body }` call when `m` is an arity-0
 # instance_eval trampoline. The entire method body is the call
 # `instance_eval(&block)`, so we splice the block body in place
 # with self rebound to the receiver. Modeled on
 # compile_yield_method_call_stmt but simpler — the trampoline body
 # has no locals/params to remap.










 # ============================================================
 # Analysis IR: serializer and loader
 # ============================================================
 #
 # The IR captures everything `analyze_phase` populates so that a
 # codegen-only step can pick up where analysis stopped without
 # re-running the whole-program inference fixpoint. The format is
 # line-oriented:
 #
 # SPINEL-IR v1
 # <tag> <name> <encoded payload>
 #
 # Tags:
 # INT <ivar> <integer> scalar int ivar
 # SA <ivar> <pipe-joined> Array<String> (each element percent-encoded)
 # IA <ivar> <comma-joined> Array<Int>
 # T <node_id> <type> per-AST-node inferred type cache
 #
 # All string payloads are percent-encoded for space/newline/tab/
 # percent/pipe so the line-and-pipe split is unambiguous. The MVP
 # dumps the analysis-bearing instance variables directly. A
 # follow-up should replace this with entity records (M / C / CONST
 # / FFI_FUNC / …) — those are the real interface — but for now this
 # gets the bootstrap pipeline running end to end.
