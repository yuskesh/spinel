# Compound index assignment on a typed array with a poly right-hand side:
# `float_array[i] += b[0]` where b is a heterogeneous (poly) array. The
# emitter added the boxed sp_RbVal straight to the unboxed slot
# (`double + sp_RbVal`), failing C compilation, while the equivalent plain
# form `a[i] = a[i] + b[0]` already folded through the tag-dispatching
# sp_poly_add. Also covers the str_array `+=` slot (native `char* + char*`
# never compiled, poly RHS or not) and `+=` on a poly_array receiver.
