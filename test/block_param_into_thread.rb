# A method's &block parameter is reachable from a Thread.new / Fiber.new block
# in that method's body. The block runs as an independent closure on its own
# fiber stack, so the method must keep a heap-materialized &blk (not be
# yield-inlined) and the call site must pass the lowered block proc. Previously
# the escape went undetected: the method was inlined and the thread closure
# referenced an undeclared lv_blk (C compile error), or -- for a class/module
# method -- the block was silently dropped at the call site.
