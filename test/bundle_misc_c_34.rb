def t_time_utc
  # Issue #418. `Time#utc` was unresolved on a Time receiver --
  # emitted a `cannot resolve call to 'utc' on time (emitting 0)`
  # warning and the result fell back to int. Sibling shape to #414
  # (iso8601 / strftime); ActiveRecord's `fill_timestamps` does
  # `Time.now.utc.iso8601` to produce UTC-suffixed timestamp
  # strings, and with iso8601 resolved post-#414 but utc still
  # unresolved, the chain broke one step earlier.
  #
  # Fix:
  #   - Runtime: sp_Time gains an `is_utc` flag (C99 compound
  #     literals zero-init the new field, so existing
  #     `(sp_Time){sec, nsec}` sites stay valid). sp_time_utc(t)
  #     returns the same instant with is_utc set; sp_time_iso8601
  #     and sp_time_strftime check the flag and dispatch through
  #     gmtime when it's set.
  #   - Codegen: compile_object_method_expr's recv_type=="time" arm
  #     dispatches `utc` to sp_time_utc.
  #   - Inference: infer_method_name_type returns "time" when mname
  #     is "utc" and recv resolves to time.
  #
  # Coverage:
  #   - Time.now.utc.iso8601 round-trip (the canonical chain) -- the
  #     output ends in "Z" rather than "+HH:MM".
  #   - Time.now.utc.strftime to verify the flag also reaches the
  #     strftime path.
  #   - utc-then-non-utc (no double-flip): subsequent .utc on an
  #     already-utc time keeps the same shape (idempotent).

  puts iso[19] == "Z" ? "utc-iso-zulu-ok" : "utc-iso-zulu-bad"
  
  # strftime against UTC: %H is the hour-of-day, which differs from
  # local hour by the timezone offset (unless we're already in
  # UTC). We can't assert an exact value (depends on system clock),
  # but we can verify it's a 2-digit number.

# === times_map_nested_array ===
def t_times_map_nested_array
  # #553 (cielavenir). `N.times.map { block-returns-array }`
  # now collects into a sp_PtrArray rather than sp_IntArray.
  # Pre-fix codegen always built sp_IntArray for the outer
  # accumulator, then `sp_IntArray_push` was handed an sp_IntArray
  # pointer as its mrb_int second argument -- -Wint-conversion
  # warning at compile time, garbage values at runtime.
  #
  # The fix routes any block-returns-array shape (int_array,
  # str_array, float_array, sym_array, poly_array, or any
  # *_ptr_array nesting) through sp_PtrArray; analyze's
  # `<inner>_ptr_array` static type already existed for the
  # normal `recv.map { array }` arm and the inspect helpers
  # (sp_IntArrayPtrArray_inspect etc.) know how to format it.

  # `use of undeclared identifier 'self'`. The ivar read also falls

  # bogus "cannot resolve call to 'push' on int" warning before the
