# Inline-at-call-site arity-0 instance-eval trampoline.
#
# Full Ruby instance-eval is dynamic — `self` is rebound at runtime,
# so AOT compilation needs static type information to resolve method
# dispatch inside the block. Spinel's compromise: detect the exact
# DSL trampoline shape `def m(&b); instance_eval(&b); end` at compile
# time, and inline the block body at the call site with `self`
# rebound to the receiver. Receiverless calls inside the spliced
# body dispatch to the receiver's class via static type inference
# (the new `@instance_eval_self_var` / `@instance_eval_self_type`).
#
# Anything other than the arity-0 single-statement shape falls
# through to the previous silent no-op — by design.

# 1. Basic trampoline: `recv.configure { add 10 }` rebinds self to
#    the Builder instance, so `add(10)` resolves as Builder#add.
class Builder
  def initialize
    @sum = 0
  end

  def add(n)
    @sum = @sum + n
  end

  def total
    @sum
  end

  def configure(&block)
    instance_eval(&block)
  end
end

b = Builder.new
b.configure do
  add(10)
  add(20)
  add(12)
end
puts b.total              #=> 42

# 2. Multiple statements inside the block — each receiverless call
#    dispatches against the rebound class, including reads.
class Counter
  def initialize
    @n = 0
  end

  def bump
    @n = @n + 1
  end

  def get
    @n
  end

  def with(&block)
    instance_eval(&block)
  end
end

c = Counter.new
c.with do
  bump
  bump
  bump
end
puts c.get                #=> 3

# 3. Nested trampolines compose: an outer Builder#configure block
#    contains an inner Counter#with block. The splicer save/restores
#    @instance_eval_self_var / @instance_eval_self_type, so the
#    outer self is restored after the inner block returns.
b2 = Builder.new
c2 = Counter.new
b2.configure do
  add(7)
  c2.with do
    bump
    bump
  end
  add(35)
end
puts b2.total             #=> 42
puts c2.get               #=> 2

# 4. Ivar read/write inside the block body. The block body splices
#    into the call site with `self` rebound, so `@n = ...` must
#    write the rebound receiver's `iv_n`, not the outer scope's
#    self. Without @self_override routing, the ivar would resolve
#    to a toplevel static-global slot -- broken silently because no
#    prior trampoline test exercises direct ivar access inside the
#    spliced block (existing tests only call methods like `bump`).
#    Counter is reused here (two instances above) so value-type
#    promotion stays disabled; the direct-ivar path needs heap
#    receivers.
c3 = Counter.new
c3.with do
  @n = @n + 5
  @n = @n + 3
end
puts c3.get               #=> 8

puts "done"
