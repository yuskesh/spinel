# The ruby/spec harness (tools/rubyspec/) prepends this file to each extracted
# single-example program. It implements just enough of mspec for the extracted
# form: `x.should == y` (the dominant matcher: ~3400 uses in language/ alone),
# should_not, =~, and the be_*/raise_error forms core/ needs. Each assertion
# prints nothing on success; on failure it prints one MSPEC-FAIL line. The
# program's exit line (MSPEC-DONE pass=N fail=M) is what the runner parses.

  # dominant matcher in core/ (eql? ~570, instance_of? ~740, include? ~620,
  # is_a? ~420, equal? ~910 uses). Each delegates to @v with the SAME call the
  # be_*/matcher forms already compile, so no new spinel surface is exercised;
  # should_not.<pred> negates through @neg in report. Without these the call

# ScratchPad is handled by the EXTRACTOR as a textual rewrite onto a plain
# LOCAL variable (scratch_pad): each extracted example is one top-level
# program, so a local suffices and blocks close over it. Every module- or
# global-based implementation tripped a different compiler gap (module
# class-ivar array length, module-self global refs, Object-reopen killing
# top-level global declaration) -- all harness-found and cataloged.
